> 🚧 **WORK IN PROGRESS (KAAM CHALU HAI)** 🚧 
> *This project is currently under active development. The core AI and 3D engine are functional, but physics, animations, and API fallbacks are being upgraded. Expect frequent UI/UX changes!*

## 🚀 The Vision
**NeuroNova** isn't just a chatbot; it's a fully reactive, voice-controlled cyber-assistant. Built with a futuristic hacker aesthetic, it features a central 3D core that physically reacts to your voice, tracks your mouse, and responds to your device's gyroscope. 

## ✨ Core Features
* **🌐 3D Interactive Core:** A rotating, pulsing Three.js gyroscope that changes colors and speeds based on its state (Sleep, Listen, Think, Speak).
* **🧲 Gyroscope & Parallax:** Tilt your device or move your mouse to see the 3D core physically track your movements.
* **🎙️ Native Voice Control:** Say *"Wake up baby"* to ignite the system. 
* **🗣️ Bilingual AI:** Speaks both Hindi and English naturally, powered by the **Google Gemini API**.
* **⚡ Local Overrides:** Hardcoded system commands to launch Spotify, open YouTube, or shut down without using API quotas.
* **🔒 Secure Core:** Password-protected initialization gateway.
